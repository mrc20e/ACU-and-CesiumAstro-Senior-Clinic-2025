# Purpose of This Repository
This repository was made by Matson Camp on the ACU Student Capstone team to develop socket programming and message formatting before final implementation into the main program.
# Main Program
The Jupyter notebook, sim_ephem_stk_solis_demo.ipynb, is the most recent version of the main program. It has been able to pull data from STK SOLIS in Austin, TX, format that data into a JSON string, and then send that data over a UDP socket to a Core Flight Systems server in Colorado.
