# Purpose of This Repository
This repository was made by Matson Camp in the ACU student team to practice socket programming and message formating before implementing those things into the main program.
# Main Program
The Jupyter notebook, sim_ephem_stk_solis_demo.ipynb, is the most recent version of the main program. It has been able to pull data from STK SOLIS in Austin, TX, format that data into a JSON string, and then send that data over a UDP socket to a Core Flight Systems server in Colorado.
